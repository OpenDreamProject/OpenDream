# DMInRoblox
A proof of concept showing that OpenDream can be used to run DM in Roblox scripts.

## Getting Started

To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "DMInRoblox.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `DMInRoblox.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
