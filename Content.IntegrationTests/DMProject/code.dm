//NOTE: Tests placed in the IntegrationTests suite
// should actually require a normal server in order to work.
// Tests that only check generic DM behaviour that is not icon nor map-facing
// should be done within Content.Tests.
// ALSO NOTE: If you're getting strange results, try rebuilding to make sure this DM file is copied correctly.

//Basic sanity check that the map actually loads correctly.
