using System.Threading.Tasks;

//
// A quick note about how we get timing right here, since it is sensitive. (I don't know where else to write it down.)
//
// When we complete a task via TaskCompletionSource, any awaiters will be **synchronously** completed.
// (assuming the awaiter doesn't have a synchronization context from a different thread, which we don't here.)
// We make heavy use of this.
//
// At the start of a tick, any spawn()/sleep()s that are supposed to resume this tick
// are still very much awaiting. The first thing we do in the update loop here is complete all of those (UpdateDelays).
// When we complete them, they will **synchronously** end up calling Schedule() on us here (through proc state stuff).
// And that then makes it available to us, to correctly resume the procs for real.
//
// Before I fixed this, there were some uses of task schedulers etc that all added various delays/thread pool jumping.
// The current system relies on async void, which works correctly.
//
// I don't like the fact that we're indirecting through so much complex .NET async logic for all of this,
// but ah well. Works for now.
